My project was developed entirely in a jupyter notebook and can be run all together in the final_project notebook. The python script 'final_project.py' and associated batch script 'final_project_batch.sbatch' can be used to run the code on the RCC. The jupyter notebook is quite computationally intensive and may take a few hours to test and train the models. 

The required data files can be located in the data folder.
